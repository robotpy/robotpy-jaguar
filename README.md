robotpy-jaguar - CAN support for Jaguar devices
===============================================

**THIS CODE IS NOT SUPPORTED NOR IS IT CURRENTLY IN A USABLE FORM**

As part of the WPILib changes for the 2017 season, complex third party devices
such as the Jaguar are not supported by WPILib core, but by the device
manufacturers. As such, RobotPy is no longer bundling the CAN Jaguar support
with it's WPILib implementation, as its probable that nobody uses it.

Versions of RobotPy prior to 2017 still contain the CANJaguar class, and it
probably works.

If you wish to fix this code, please contact the RobotPy team and we'd be happy
to give you advice for doing so.
